# The most important place of the bot in the game is to offer us the best possibilities.Firstly, tip given to us,
# it tells us the number or color that is most frequently in our deck.I did not consider the job here as "just" giving a
# tip according to the card to be put on the stack. Because the tip given also helps with the cards to be deleted.
# For this reason, I directed bot's intelligence to the cards it would discard.
# Because removing a card that will be needed from his hand may reflect very badly on the possibilities in the process
# of the game. To complete it with high score, the bot and the player must leave the best cards in their hands.

# For this reason, my priorities for eliminating cards in the pick_discard section can be counted as follows:
# 1) If the card is already on the stack
# 2) If bot has two of the same card in it deck (the number and color must be known)
# 3) If the number of card has already passed on either side of the stack
# 4) If only the color is known and the stack containing that color is already full
# 5) If there is no information about the card
# 6) If there is just color known about the card
# 7) If there is just number known about the card

# The goal of the discard sequence I'm doing is to protect the potentially useful card as much as possible.
